# Code Challenge

Congrats on building your first app today!  Let's see if you can step up your skills.

Your code challenge for this week is to create a temperature converter.  Your app should be a single-view app that takes a temperature as an input in clesius, and returns that temperature in fahrenheit.  

Your app should neccesarily include:
+ Text box
+ Labels
+ Button

+ IBAction(s)

See if you can get your app to incude the following bonus items:
+ An app that can handle both conversaion directions (i.e. F-C and C-F)
